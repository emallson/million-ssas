* Chez Scheme Implementation

  Pros:

  - Love the syntax in general
  - Reasonably performant

  Cons:

  - Chez doesn't have much support from the ecosystem.
    + May want to check out Chicken b/c it very much does.
  - Difficult to write a reasonable-to-read greedy loop. May just need to decompose more.
